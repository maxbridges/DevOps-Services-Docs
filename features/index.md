## Git hosting

It's simple to track, plan, and develop your project, and you don't have to give up your favorite SCM. You can quickly create a project with a Git repository to share your source with team members (private projects), or with the world. Edit your source, push commits, and automatically deploy changes to the cloud, all without leaving your browser. Your favorite Git client is supported too.

<a name='gitrepo'></a>
## Connect with your GitHub repository
			
It's easy to link work items with GitHub code changes: use your tools to code, and manage your project with IBM&reg; Bluemix&reg; DevOps Services. You can reference a work item in GitHub comments before you push code changes, and the work item is updated with the new commit information.

## Your work in one place

At a glance, see the projects that you own, belong to, and like. You can also see requests to join your project and invitations for you to join other projects. Just another way to help you stay organized.

<a name='simpleui'></a>
## Simple user interface for starting a project quickly

Easily add the "who, what, and when" of your development project. It takes only a few minutes to set dates, document your first user story, assign a task or two, and dive in to the code.

<a name='sync'></a>
##Update a running app automatically with Bluemix Live Sync

Edit static files in Node.js apps and immediately propagate the changes to the deployed app by using the IBM&reg; Bluemix&reg; Live Sync feature. 

In the Web IDE, turn on Live Edit and see your updated static files immediately. Update a node module and use the **Quick Restart** icon to restart the Node run time in a matter of seconds, without redeploying the app. 

Use the Debugger to create breakpoints and inspect variables in your node modules so you can isolate problem areas as you work.

<a name='scm'></a>
## Built-in source code management						

Easily deliver code and seamless track changes from all developers. 
Each project gets a Git repository or a Jazz source code management repository and workspace where project members check in changes, associate code changes with work items, and view a history of recent updates.

<a name='build'></a>
## Build and deploy your way

Configure your project to automatically deploy whenever a project member pushes code to your Git repository or Jazz&trade;  Source Code Management (SCM) repository to [Bluemix](//bluemix.net/ "Bluemix"). You can deploy files as they are pushed, or you can configure more advanced build options to be deployed automatically.

<a name='wis'></a>
## Work items to track and plan project activities						

Track who's doing what, and when it will get done. Need a design? Open a task and assign it to the person who has wireframing tools. Is something not working? Open a defect. Expect to feel great when you complete a work item and change the status to Done.
