#Setting up GitHub for Bluemix DevOps Services projects

###### Last updated: 6 January 2016

If you have source code in a GitHub repository, or if you plan to, you can connect that repo to an IBM&reg; Bluemix&reg; DevOps Services project. When your project is connected to a GitHub repo, you can track changes between DevOps Services and GitHub automatically or manually. You can also automate the deployment of the source in your GitHub repo to your app on IBM&reg; Bluemix&reg;.

 For a complete GitHub reference, [see the official Git documentation](https://help.github.com/).

###	Change from a DevOps Services repo to a GitHub repo that you already have 

1. Sign in to [DevOps Services][1]. The My Projects page opens.  
**Important**: To avoid losing your work, make sure that all code changes are committed before you continue. When you update your project to use a GitHub repo, your current Git repo and any pending changes in it are deleted.
2. For the project that you want to change, click the project settings icon.    
![My Project page with project settings icon][15]  
3. On the General page, click **CHANGE REPOSITORY**.  
![CHANGE REPOSITORY button on the General page of project settings][16]  
4. If you are prompted to authorize with GitHub, do so and then return to DevOps Services.  
5. Click **SELECT AN EXISTING REPO**.  
![Select an existing repo button on the change repository page][20]
**Tip**: If a repo in the list is being used by another project, that repo is not available. To determine which project is using a repo, select the repo. You can see the associated project if it is public or if you are a member of it.
6. Follow the prompts to select a repo. When you are finished, click **SUBMIT**.  

You can verify that your project is associated with your GitHub repo by clicking **Git URL** on the project's Overview page. The URL includes `github.com`; for example, `https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/DevOps-Services-Docs.git`.

###Change from a GitHub repo to a new GitHub repo

To change from a GitHub repo to a new GitHub repo, you first configure your project to use the new GitHub repo and then move the contents from the older repo to the new one.

####Configure your project to use a new GitHub repo
1. Sign in to [DevOps Services][1]. The My Projects page opens.  
2. For the project that you want to change, click the project settings icon.   
![My Project page with project settings icon][15]  
3. On the General page, click **CHANGE REPOSITORY**.

####Move the content from your older GitHub repo to your new GitHub repo

To move the content from one GitHub repo to another, you must use the command line. For more information about the commands to use, see [the official Git reference](https://git-scm.com/docs).  

1. Either clone your older repo or update it to the latest.
  * If you don't have a local clone of the older repo, enter this command: 
  ```
  git clone existing_repo_url
  ```
  * If you have a local clone of the older repo, fetch to get the latest content:
  ```
  git fetch origin
  ```  
2. Add the new repo as a remote repo:
  ```
  git remote add new-origin new_repo_url
  ```
3. Clone all of the remote branches locally:  
  a. List all of the branches:
  ```
  git branch -a
  ```  
  b. Fetch a local copy of the remote branches, which are branches in the list that include `remotes/origin/*branch*`):
  ```
  git checkout -b branch_name origin/branch_name
  ```
3. Push all branches and tags to the new repo:
  ```
  git push --all new-origin
  git push --tags new-origin
  ```
4. **Optional:** Update the local repo to use only the new repo:
  ```
  git remote rm origin 
  git remote rename new-origin origin
  ```  

You can verify that your project is associated with your GitHub repo by clicking **Git URL** on the project's Overview page. The URL includes `github.com`; for example, `https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/DevOps-Services-Docs.git`.

## Setting up the GitHub hook

If you want the GitHub repo to create a link to a related work item whenever the repo receives a push, configure a service hook. The hook adds a link to a work item whenever a change is pushed to your repo and you include a work item keyword and number in the commit message. 

### Before you begin

The IBM Bluemix DevOps Services hook replaces the RationalJazzHub hook. If you configured the RationalJazzHub hook, disable it and configure the IBM Bluemix DevOps Services hook instead.

### Configuring the service hook

1. In your GitHub repo, on the right, click **Settings**.
![GitHub settings link.][4]
2. Click **Webhooks & services**.
![GitHub web hooks and services link.][5]
3. Click **Add service**, and from the **Available Services** list, select **IBM Bluemix DevOps Services**.
4. If you are using public GitHub, type your IBM id and password. If you are using GitHub Enterprise, type your company user name and password. 
5. Select the **Active** check box.   
 **Tip:** If you need to disable work item linking later, return to this page and clear the **Active** check box.  
![Configuration settings for the IBM Bluemix DevOps Services hook][6]

6. Click **Add service**.

You can now link work items to your commits. The next time that you commit a change, type a keyword and the work item's number in the commit comment; for example, `task 530`. When you push the change, a link to the change set is generated on the work item's **LINKS** tab. For a list of valid keywords, see [Testing the hook](#create_work_item).
![Commit comment with work item keyword and number][7]

<a name='create_work_item'></a>
## Testing the hook

To test your hook, create a work item and commit a change to your code.

1. On the DevOps Services project's Overview page, click **TRACK & PLAN**.
2. In the **Create a work item** field, type a summary and any work item attributes that you need.
3. Click **CREATE**.
4. Note the task number so that you can add it to your comment when you commit your change.
5. Change one of the files in your GitHub repo. This example uses the DevOps Services Web IDE, but you can use any editor.
6. Add a commit comment that includes a work-item keyword and number. 
You can use these keywords for hooks:
   - `adoption item`
   - `bug`
   - `defect`
   - `epic`
   - `impediment`
   - `item`
   - `retrospective`
   - `story`
   - `task`
   - `track build item`
   - `work item`    
   In this example, the keyword is `task` and number is `530`.
![Commit comment in Web IDE][8]
7. Commit and push the change.
8. Open your work item. On the **LINKS** tab, click the change set.   
![Work item link to the change set.][9]
9. View the commit on the Git Log page.   
![Commit on Git Log page][12]   
10. To view the changed file in GitHub, click **View in GitHub**.   
![View in GitHub link.][13]   
11. View the changes in GitHub.
![Changed file in GitHub.][10]    

If your link isn't working as expected, [troubleshoot the hook][14].

##Adding a link after a change is pushed

If you already pushed a change and need to link it to a work item, follow these steps:
1. Open your project's Overview page.
1. Click **GIT LOG**.
1. Open the commit.
1. Click **Link Work Item**.
1. Select the work item and click **OK**.

A link to the change set is listed on the work item's **LINKS** tab. You can review the commit details by clicking the change-set link on the work item. From there, you can view the changed files by clicking the GitHub links. ![Link to view changes in GitHub.][11]

##Building the source from your repo and deploying to Bluemix

To automate the deployment of the source in your GitHub repo to your app on Bluemix, you can configure a Build & Deploy pipeline. After you set up your pipeline, you can request your deployments manually or configure them to run automatically when you push changes to your GitHub repo. For information about setting up a pipeline, [see the Build & Deploy reference](/docs/deploy/).
