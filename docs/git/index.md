#Git source control 

###### Last updated: 24 June 2016

If you store your code in a Git repository that is hosted by IBMÂ® Bluemix&trade; DevOps Services, you can work with code in a Git terminal or in a web IDE. You can also use GitHub source control with DevOps Services projects. If you work on a local workstation, you can use Git terminal commands to edit the contents of your Git repo. If you use the Web IDE, you don't need the Git terminal: you can run many common Git commands in the Web IDE. 

For information about using a GitHub repo, [see Setting up GitHub for DevOps Services projects][8]. For a complete Git reference, [see the official Git documentation][6].

To access Git commands from the Web IDE, click the **Git Repository** icon <img class="inline" src="./images/gitrepository.png" alt="Git Respository icon">.

**Note:** For a Git repo that is hosted by DevOps Services, the file size limit is 100 MB.

No matter where you code, you can use this quick reference to do common tasks.

### Set up a local Git repo

#### DevOps Services Web IDE
When you use a Git repo with your DevOps Services project, you work with both your local and remote repos through the Web IDE.

1. Click **EDIT CODE** <img class="inline" src="./images/editcode.gif" alt="Edit code button"> and start coding!

#### Git terminal
If you want to code and test locally, set up a local repo.

**Before you begin**: If Git is not installed on your computer, [follow these instructions][1].

1. Determine which directory to store your local repo in. If necessary, you can create a directory.

1. By using your terminal, move to the directory.  

1. [Go to DevOps Services][2]. On the My Projects page, click your project's name.

1. From your project's Overview page, click **Git URL** and copy the URL.  
**Note**: DevOps Services supports the HTTPS protocol for Git URLs. The SSH and Git protocols are not supported.

1. In your terminal, type `git clone `, paste your Git URL, and press Enter.

1. When you are prompted, enter your alias and personal access token or IBM id password.      
    
    **Notes**: 
    * If you are not prompted for your password, do not continue.  Delete your cloned repo and repeat the steps by using a modified repo address: `https://your_alias:your_IBM_ID_password@hub.jazz.net/alias/project_name`.
    * Your user ID for DevOps Services can be either an IBM id or a federated ID (corporate ID). If you use federated authentication, you must use a personal access token instead of a password. For more information about creating a personal access token, see [What's federated authentication and how does it affect me?](https://developer.ibm.com/devops-services/2016/06/23/whats-federated-authentication-and-how-does-it-affect-me/)


1. After your repo replicates, move into your new local repo.  

<a name="existing_git_repository"></a>
### Use an existing Git repo with DevOps Services projects 
If you already have a Git repo, you can use it with a DevOps Services project.

#### Setting up a new DevOps Services project with an existing Git repo
1. [Go to DevOps Services][2]. On the My Projects page, click **CREATE PROJECT**.
2. Name your project.
3. Click **Create a new repository**.
4. Click **Create a Git repo on Bluemix**.    
**Note:** Do not select the **Initialize the repository with a README and license template** check box. 
5. Select or clear the other project options as needed.
6. Click **CREATE**.
7. Open a command-line window and change to your Git repo directory.
8. Push the contents of the repo by typing these commands:         
       git remote add new_repo https://hub.jazz.net/git/your_alias/project_name     
       git push -u new_repo master     

#### Replacing a DevOps Services Git repo with another Git repo
If you have a DevOps Services project with an initialized Git repo and you want to use another Git repo instead, you must be the owner or an administrator of the project. To overwrite the repo, add a `-f` (force push) to the `git push` command, like this: `git push -f -u new_repo master`.

**Important:** A force push replaces your original DevOps Services Git repo; that repo cannot be recovered.
       
<a name="replace_your_origin_repository"></a>
### Replace your origin repo

#### DevOps Services Web IDE

1. Click the configuration icon <img  class="inline" src="./images/configuration.png" alt="Configuration icon">.

1. In the remote.origin.url pane, click the edit icon <img  class="inline" src="./images/editconfiguration.png" alt="Edit icon"> to edit the configuration entry.

1. In the **value** field, paste your new repo URL. Click **Submit**.

1. Click the **REFERENCE** list and expand **origin**. Click the fetch icon <img class="inline" src="./images/fetchfromremote.png" alt="Fetch icon"> to fetch from the remote repo.

#### Git terminal

1. Type `git remote set-url origin <repository_url>` and press Enter.


<a name="integrate_local_commits_in_the_web_IDE"></a>
###Integrate local commits in the Web IDE

When you work in the Web IDE, both your local and remote repos are hosted on the cloud. To view the changes that you made in a local repo that is stored outside of DevOps Services, you must sync to your remote repo.

1. Click **SYNC**. Sync combines the fetch, rebase, and push commands.


<a name="git_submodules"></a>
###Work with Git submodules

If your DevOps Services project uses a Git repo and you want to add or use another repo in the project, add a Git submodule. A submodule is a Git repo's clone that is within a subdirectory of another repo. You can use submodules to include projects that are developed by third parties or projects that you are developing separately.

#### Add a Git submodule

1. In the Web IDE, click the **Repository** menu.
2. Next to the repo to add a submodule to, click the **Add Git Submodule** icon <img class="inline" src="./images/addsubmodule.png" alt="Add Git Submodule">.
3. Type the repository URL of the new submodule.
4. Click **Submit**.

The submodule is placed in a subdirectory of your initial repo.

#### Initialize nested submodules

If you add a submodule that contains nested submodules, they are shows as unknown repositories in the **Repository** menu and as empty folders in the Web IDE.  You must initialize the nested submodules:

1. From the **Repository** menu, find the parent repo of the submodules..
2. Click the **Sync** icon <img class="inline" src="./images/syncsubmodule.png" alt="Sync Submodule">, and then click the **Update** icon <img class="inline" src="./images/updatesubmodule.png" alt="Update Submodule">.

#### Commit and push submodule changes

When you update a submodule, you must push the changes to the submodule and to all parent repos.

1. From the **Reference** menu, check out the branch to commit to.  The submodule is initially in Detached Head state.
2. Commit and push the changes. These changes are reflected in the parent repo.

#### Remove a submodule

To remove a submodule, click the **Repository** menu.  Next to the submodule to remove, click the **Remove submodule** icon <img class="inline" src="./images/deletesubmodule.png" alt="Delete Submodule">.


<a name="github_pull_requests"></a>
### Work with GitHub pull requests

If your DevOps Services project was cloned from a GitHub repository, you can work with the pull requests that are associated with the GitHub repo.

1. In the Web IDE, open the Git repository page. 
2. From the **References** list, select **Pull requests**.
3. Type the user name and password or a private key that is associated with your GitHub account.

 <img class="screen-shot" src="./images/pullrequestlogin.png" alt="Pull request authentication window">
 
4. Click the **References** list again and expand the **Pull requests** section.

All of the available pull requests are displayed. For each pull request, you have two options:

1. Check out the change into a new remote branch, where you can review and merge the pull request. To check out the change, click the **Checkout the pull request and make it active** icon <img class="inline" src="./images/checkoutpullrequest.png" alt="Checkout Pull Request">.
2. Open the GitHub page that is associated with the pull request in a new browser tab. To open the GitHub page, click the **Open the GitHub page for this Pull Request** icon <img class="inline" src="./images/openpullrequest.png" alt="Open Pull Request">.
