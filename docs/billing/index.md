##Setting up a DevOps Services account

1.	[Sign up for an account](https://hub.jazz.net/). When you sign up, you need to either create an alias or use an existing one. An *alias* is a publicly visible short name. Your alias is included in the URL of each project that you own. The first time you log in to DevOps Services, you link your IBM id with an alias. If you have a Jazz ID, that is used as your alias.
2.	After your IBM id and alias are linked, you can log in to DevOps Services from a web browser or an IBM® Rational Team Concert™ client. In addition, you can access a Git repository from your local Git client.

	* To log in from a web browser, use your IBM id credentials. 
	* To log in from a Rational Team Concert client, use your alias and IBM ID password.
	* To access a Git repository from your local Git client, use your alias and IBM id password.

**Tips:**
* If you have authentication problems or if you are linked to the wrong account, you can request support by sending an email to [idslogin@jazz.net](mailto:idslogin@jazz.net). To change the email address of the DevOps Services account that is associated with your IBM id, open your profile, click PERSONAL INFORMATION, and update your email address.
* When you update the email address of your DevOps Services account, the email address of the associated IBM id isn’t automatically updated; you must synchronize the accounts. To synchronize the accounts, [update the email address for the linked IBM id](https://www.ibm.com/account/profile/us?page=signinview). If you don't synchronize the accounts, the next time that you log in to DevOps Services, you will be prompted to synchronize them.

##Bluemix accounts

<!--All DevOps Services projects include an allowance of free services. If you exceed your allowances, your work is interrupted. To avoid interruptions, set up a Bluemix billing account and configure your services. By configuring your Bluemix account, you also get advanced features for monitoring your builds, deployments, and the status of your projects.--> 

<!--If you plan to use the Delivery Pipeline (Build & Deploy) and Track & Plan services beyond the free allowance, configure both services. Each service requires a separate billing configuration.-->

##Setting up a billing account

Before you set up your billing account, determine what the best plan for your project is. [Learn more about billing accounts](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#acctmgmt/billing.html#bil_plan).

**Important:** The person who is responsible for setting up the billing account might not be the same person who is most affected by build and deployment failures and blocked access to Track & Plan views. If you are not the person who sets up the account, ask your Bluemix billing manager to enable your billing account early.

To set up your billing account, complete these steps: 
1. Go to your Bluemix Dashboard and select the space that is listed in your DevOps Services project settings. 
2. Click **Services** and click **Add a Service or API**.
3. From the DevOps section, select either **Delivery Pipeline** or **Track & Plan**.
4. In the "Add Service" section, make sure that the space that corresponds to your  DevOps Services project is selected.
5. From the **Selected Plan** list, select a billing plan. 
6. Click **CREATE.**-->
