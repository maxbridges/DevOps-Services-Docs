# Integrating Slack with Bluemix DevOps Services <em><span style="color: #35b2d5">Beta</span></em>

###### Last updated: 14 October 2015

Slack provides real-time messaging for team communications. You can integrate Slack with your IBM&reg; Bluemix&trade; DevOps Services project so that notifications about build results from your Build &amp; Deploy pipeline are posted on a Slack channel. 

**Important:** This integration feature is beta quality. After you [enable your project to use the integration feature](#enabling_the_beta_features), you cannot disable or modify it. To test the Slack integration in a copy of your project, [fork another DevOps Services project](#forking_a_devops_services_project). Otherwise, open a [sample](https://hub.jazz.net/project/idsorg/sample-java-cloudant/overview) and click the **Deploy to Bluemix** button to deploy sample code and create a toolchain that you can test the Slack integration in.

## Before you begin
* You must have accounts with these services and tools:
   * [DevOps Services](https://hub.jazz.net) 
   * [IBM Bluemix](http://bluemix.net/)
   * [Slack](https://slack.com/) 
* You must have at least one DevOps Services project with a pipeline that you can use to deploy your app. Otherwise, open a [sample](https://hub.jazz.net/project/idsorg/sample-java-cloudant/overview) and click the **Deploy to Bluemix** button to deploy sample code and create a toolchain that does not already integrate with Slack.

##Forking a project

You can test the Slack integration in a copy of your project without changing the original version by forking a DevOps Services project.

2. Click **EXPLORE**, find the project to start from, and click its name.

3. Click **FORK PROJECT**. When you fork a project, the original project's source is copied into a new DevOps Services project that you own.

4. In the Fork Project window that opens, type your project name, review the project information, and specify options as needed. For more information, [see Creating a project from DevOps Services](/docs/startproject#starting_a_devops_services_project).
