#Setting up local clients to work with Git source control 

###### Last updated: 24 June 2016


If you use a Git repository for your IBM&reg; Bluemix&trade; DevOps Services project, you can manage your repo and work locally or in the DevOps Services Web IDE. You can either use the command line to access your repo or, if you work in Eclipse, install the EGit plug-in for version control.

If you use the Track & Plan feature and you want to manage your project plans and work items locally from Eclipse, install the IBM Rational Team Concert™ plug-in.

## Accessing your Git repo from your DevOps Services project

If you have a DevOps Services project that uses Git, you can connect the project to a Git repo in two ways:

* [Option 1: Accessing your repo by using command-line Git](#command_line_git)
* [Option 2: Accessing your repo by using Eclipse and the EGit plug-in](#eclipse_using_egit)

<a name='command_line_git'></a>
### Option 1: Accessing your repo by using command-line Git

If you know how to use the command line with Git, you can use this method to manage your repo. 

<a name='clone_your_git_project_from_the_command_line'></a>
#### Cloning your Git project from the command line

Create a local copy of the project files by cloning the Git repo so that you can access the contents of your repo outside the Web IDE. 

**Before you begin**

Check whether Git is installed. On a command line, type `git version`. If Git is installed, the version number is shown and you can begin. If Git is not installed, [go to the Git website](http://git-scm.com/downloads). Download and install the version for your operating system. You can accept the default installation values.

**Cloning your project**

1. Sign in to [DevOps Services](https://hub.jazz.net/).

2. Navigate to your project page.

2. From the right side of the page, copy the content of the **Git URL** field.  
 **Note**: DevOps Services supports the HTTPS protocol for Git URLs. The SSH and Git protocols are not supported.  
![The Git URL field on the Project page.][3]
3. Open a command line.

4. Change the directory to where you want the local copy of the Git repo to be.

5. Type `git clone`, paste the Git URL, and press Enter. 

6. When you are prompted, type your alias and IBM password.   
**Note:** If you are not prompted for your password, do not continue. Delete your cloned repo and repeat the steps by using a modified repo address: 
`https://your_alias:your_IBM_ID_password@hub.jazz.net/git/alias/project_name`.

After the download is complete, you have a local repo of the files for your project. For more information about using Git, [see the Git documentation](http://git-scm.com/doc).

### Option 2: Accessing your repo by using Eclipse and the EGit plug-in


If you use Eclipse and have a project that uses Git for source control, you can use the EGit plug-in to manage your repo from Eclipse. 

<a name='install_the_egit_eclipse_plugin'></a>
#### Installing the EGit Eclipse plug-in

**Before you begin**: 

* If you use Eclipse 4.2.2 or later, complete these steps. If you use an earlier version of Eclipse, [see the EGit/FAQ page for instructions](http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/FAQ#Where_can_I_find_older_releases_of_EGit.3F).  
* If you do not have Eclipse installed and want tools for Java™ development, [download and install Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/keplersr2).  
* If you do not have Java 1.7 installed, [download and install the Java SE Development Kit](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html).
* Check whether the EGit plug-in is already installed. In Eclipse, click **Window > Show View > Other** and type `git` as the filter text. If you see a list of Git views, skip to [Connect to your DevOps Services project by using EGit](#connect_to_your_devops_services_project_with_egit).

**Installing the plug-in**
1. In Eclipse, click **Help > Install New Software...**.

2. In the Install window, complete these steps:
  1. In the **Work with** field, type `http://download.eclipse.org/egit/updates` and click **Add...** and type a name for this install repo.
  2. In the Eclipse Git Team Provider section, select only the **Eclipse Git Team Provider** check box.
![Installing the Eclipse Git Team Provider][21] 

  3. Click **Next** and click **Next** again.
  4. Review the license terms. If you agree to the terms, accept them.
  5. Click **Finish** to install the plug-in.
4. If you see a security warning message, click **OK**.

5. If you are prompted to restart Eclipse, click **Yes**.

#### Connecting EGit to your DevOps Services project

1. In Eclipse, set the default character encoding to UTF-8.
  * If you use a Mac, click **Eclipse > Preferences > General > Workspace**. In the "Text file encoding" section, click **Other**, and from the list, select **UTF-8**.
  * If you use a Windows system, click **Window > Preferences > General > Workspace**. In the "Text file encoding" section, click **Other**, and from the list, select **UTF-8**.

2. In [DevOps Services](https://hub.jazz.net/), browse to your project page. 

2. On the right side of the page, copy the **Git URL**.  
 **Note**: DevOps Services supports the HTTPS protocol for Git URLs. The SSH and Git protocols are not supported.  
![The Git URL field on the Project page.][3]

3. In Eclipse, click **File > Import**.

4. In the Import window, click **Git > Projects from Git**, and then click **Next**. 

5. Select **Clone URI** and click **Next**. 

6. In the **URI** field, paste the Git URL.

7. In the Authentication section, type your alias and personal access token or IBM id password, and then click **Next**.    

    **Note**: Your user ID for DevOps Services can be either an IBM id or a federated ID (corporate ID). If you use federated authentication, to log in to your Eclipse client, you must use a personal access token instead of a password. If you don't use federated authentication, your IBM id and password work with all clients. For more information about creating a personal access token, see [What’s federated authentication and how does it affect me?](https://developer.ibm.com/devops-services/2016/06/23/whats-federated-authentication-and-how-does-it-affect-me/)

8. Select the branches to work on and click **Next**.

9. If necessary, update the local destination directory for the cloned repo and click **Next**. 

10. If you are importing an Eclipse project, click **Import existing Eclipse projects**, otherwise click **Import as a general project**.

11. Click **Finish**.

12. Type a project name and click **Finish**.

13. To work on this project, click **Window > Open Perspective**, select **Other** and select **Git**.  The Git Repositories view lists your connected Git repos.  You could also use the **Project Explorer** view.

## Developing with Bluemix Live Sync and Node.js

If you are developing a Node.js app, you can make changes to static files, such as HTML or CSS, and immediately propagate the changes to the deployed app by using the Bluemix Live Sync. 

In the Web IDE, turn on Live Edit mode. You can see your updated static files by refreshing the app in your browser. If you update a node module, use the **Quick Restart** icon to restart the node run time in seconds, without redeploying the app.
![The Quick Restart icon.][23]


With the Debug feature of Bluemix Live Sync, you can create breakpoints and inspect variables in your node modules so that you can isolate problems as you work. For more information about Bluemix Live Sync, [see the Bluemix Live Sync documentation][1].

<a name='etools'></a>
## Developing with IBM Eclipse Tools

IBM&reg; Eclipse Tools for Bluemix&trade; provides plug-ins that you can install into an existing Eclipse environment to assist in integrating your IDE with Bluemix.

With the tools, you can deploy the following types of files and servers to the Bluemix server directly from your Eclipse IDE or from IBM&reg; WebSphere&reg; Application Server Developer Tools (WDT):
* JavaScript files
* WAR (web archive) files
* EAR (enterprise archive) files
* Liberty Profile packaged servers

You can also create services and link them to your app, and define environment variables as part of the deployment. For more information about IBM Eclipse Tools, [see Deploying apps with IBM Eclipse Tools for Bluemix][2].
